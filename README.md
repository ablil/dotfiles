# Getting started

This is a guide on how to setup dotfiles your local machine.

```

**Fedora**:

```sh
  sudo dnf install vim git curl wget vlc tmux
```

## Installation

1. Prepare your local machine and clone the projets. **clone the repo**

```sh
  git clone https://github.com/ablil/dotfiles $HOME/dotfiles
```

2. Set environment variable (_this is important because all of the scripts are
   based on this location!_):

```sh
  export DOTFILES=$HOME/dotfiles
```

# Usage

This will guide you how to setup all of these dotfiles on your machine. Most of
the thing can be configured with `install.sh` which is a simple bash script to
links dotfiles from the repo to your local machine.

Some directories may have a specific install script for them inside their
relative directory (eg, Vscode, Intellji Idea)

oh-my-zsh, vim, tmux & git

**Other setups**
