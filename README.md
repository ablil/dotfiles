# dotfiles -- The developer's quick setup
A biased collection of dotfiles with default universal configuration.

*dotfiles are used to customize system configuration, they are derived from Unix-like configuration files that starts with a dot. Google this stuff for more info*

# :thinking: why ?
For three main reasons:
* Centralize all dotfiles in one place
* Keep track of dotfiles
* Productivity and speed


# :hammer: Usage
It is very simple, clone the repository and link symbolically any dotfile you want.

If you want to speed the process, run the script `install.sh` which defines an array of dotfiles to be linked symbolically for you.

*PS: you don't want to link all dotfiles, because it does not make sense to link for example .prettierrc globally*

# :fire: What's inside ?
